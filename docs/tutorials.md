# Tutorials

The following are tutorials for each of the functions available in this package.

* area_of_rectangle:
    This function takes two integers or floats and will compute the area based on the inputs.

    Example:
    a = 3 
    b = 4
    c = area_of_rectangle(a,b)
    print(c)
    Output: 12
    Note this example uses integers but floats can be used as well.

* perimeter_of_rectangle:
    This function takes two integers or floats and will compute the perimeter based on the inputs

    Example:
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = perimeter_of_rectangle(a,b)
    print(c)
    Output: 14
    Note this example uses integers but floats can be used as well.

* my_adder:
    This function takes 3 integers or floats and computes their sum.

    Example:
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = 5
    d = my_adder(a,b,c)
    print(d)
    Output: 12
    Note this example uses integers but floats can be used as well.

* my_thermo_stat: 
    This function takes a current and desired temperature and determines the status of your thermostat.

    Example:
    current_temp = 30
    desired_temp = 40
    status = my_thermo_stat(30,40)
    print(status)
    Output: Heat

*have_digits:
    This function loops over all the characters in a string and returns a 0 if no digits and a 1 if digits are present.

    Example:
    string = 'hello'
    no = have_digits(string)
    print(no)
    Output: 0
