# Explanation

The functions in this package use simple mathmatical and logical operations in-order to achieve similarly simple goals.

    * area_of_rectangle: uses the equation W x H (width x height), this function is well known and widly used.
    * perimeter_of_rectangle: uses the simple equation 2W x 2H (2(width) + 2(height)), this function is well knonw and widly used.
    * my_adder: calculates the total (sum) of three numbers using addition (a + b + c = total), summation is the term used for these types of operations.
    * my_thermo_stat: determines the status of your thermostat by using subtraction and compairing to a threshold. This threshold determines whether or not you thermostat is heating, cooling, or off. Comparisons are made by checking the current temperature against a desired temperature.
    * have_digits: checks whether a given word has numerical digits by checking each letter of the word. The function loops over all the chracters within a word (string) when a digit is found the funtion sends the equivalent of a boolean to let the computer know whether or not there is a digit present.
